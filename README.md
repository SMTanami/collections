# collections
Collections is a project that focuses on adding a library of familiar collections for use in Go. Such collections include implementations for : Queue, Stack, PriorityQueue, Circular Queue's (Ring Buffers), and more when they come to mind or are requested. As more gets added to library, more will be added to the README file.
